# Colourful-Floral-Design
An example of combining turtle graphics with colour theory and circular repetitions.
This project uses the Python Turtle module to simulate a colourful floral design through procedural graphics. 
It imitates a flower which is made of 18 curved petals, and the entire design rotates and shifts with each iteration.
